<h2> Low and Slow</h2>
<p> This week I am <b>extemely</b> excited about a new cooking technique called <em><dfn>sous vide</dfn></em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge
the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want
the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q> </p>
<p> Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.
 <br>To reserve a seat at the chef table,
contact us <i>before</i> <time>November 30.</time></br></p>
